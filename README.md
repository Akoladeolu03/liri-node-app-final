# liri-node-app
Liri is like iphone's Siri or window's contana. However, Liri is an app with command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data unlike siri and Contana that are speech interpretation and recognition interface.

## Overview
The app depends on some important packages/credentials and keys to run or load. These packages are called dependencies. Once the keys(key.js, .env and package .jason) are fully initialized using our client id and secret Id then our app can be ready to read our code. It is also important to note the following function or command line as we write our code
1. The Function for running a Spotify search,
2. This function gets us the name of the artist,the title of the song etc.
3. The function Prints data about each concert and use of moment to format date.,
4. The "if" Statement.
5. The Function for running a Movie Search,
6. The Function for running a command based on text file,
7. Function for determining which command is executed,
8. Function which takes in command line arguments and executes correct function accordingly.
9. I encountered some bugs and the app development was time cosumimg. However, I was able to build the app successfuly.
